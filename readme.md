# Simple LAMP Server

## ABOUT:
This will automatically prompt you with everything nessecary in order to deploy whatever is in public/ to a LAMP server on GCP. It also will automatically create certificates. Domain registration and record setting must be done manually. This is my website that contains links to my current projects.

## USAGE:

```bash
./go.sh
```
